# Morse Code Converter

This is a simple web application that allows you to convert text to Morse code and vice versa.

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to convert into Morse code in the "Enter Text" textarea.
2. Click on the "Encrypt to Morse Code" button to convert the text.
3. The Morse code will be displayed in the textarea labeled "Morse Code."

Alternatively:

1. Enter the Morse code you want to decode in the "Enter Morse Code" textarea.
2. Click on the "Decrypt from Morse Code" button to convert the Morse code.
3. The decoded text will be displayed in the textarea labeled "Decoded Text."

## How It Works

- The application uses JavaScript to perform the conversion.
- It maps each character to its corresponding Morse code representation.
- When converting text to Morse code, it iterates through each character of the input text and replaces it with its Morse code equivalent.
- Similarly, when decoding Morse code, it splits the input into words and then into individual characters to find their corresponding letters.
- The conversion is case-insensitive and handles spaces gracefully.
